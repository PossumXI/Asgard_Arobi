## Tips for Best Results

1. **Speak clearly** - Giru uses Google Speech Recognition
2. **Use natural language** - Talk like you would to a colleague
3. **Be specific** - "Weather in Paris" is better than just "weather"
4. **Wait for response** - Giru will speak the answer
5. **Use Push-to-Talk** - Click and hold for reliable input
6. **Check model** - Say "what model" to see which AI is responding

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Giru doesn't respond | Say wake word clearly |
| Wrong command understood | Use Push-to-Talk button |
| AI response is slow | Switch to Groq (free & fast) |
| ASGARD system offline | Check service is running |
