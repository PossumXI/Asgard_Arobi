## Automation Scripts

### Docker Log Monitor (`docker_monitor.ps1`)

Automatically monitors Docker container logs, detects errors, and documents issues.

```powershell
# Single run - check current status
.\docker_monitor.ps1

# Continuous monitoring (every 5 minutes)
.\docker_monitor.ps1 -Continuous

# Custom interval (every 10 minutes)
.\docker_monitor.ps1 -Continuous -IntervalMinutes 10

# With auto-fix enabled
.\docker_monitor.ps1 -Continuous -FixErrors
```

### Audit Trigger (`audit_trigger.ps1`)

Monitors file changes across the codebase.

```powershell
# Single audit check
.\audit_trigger.ps1

# Continuous monitoring
.\audit_trigger.ps1 -Continuous
```

## Conventions

- Store generated artifacts under `Documentation/` only.
- Keep human-written docs concise and cross-link to generated outputs.
- Append build events to `Documentation/Build_Log.md`.
- Docker status is automatically updated in `Docker_Logs.md`.
