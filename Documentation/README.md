# Documentation Directory

This folder is the single source of truth for build and deployment documentation
generated by the system. All architecture notes, API docs, build logs, and
generated specifications belong here.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Backend_Architecture.md` | System architecture overview |
| `Build_Log.md` | Build events and deployment history |
| `Credentials_Registry.md` | All service credentials and connection strings |
| `Docker_Logs.md` | Docker container status and error tracking |
| `Audit_Activity.md` | File change audit log |

## Automation Scripts

### Docker Log Monitor (`docker_monitor.ps1`)

Automatically monitors Docker container logs, detects errors, and documents issues.

```powershell
# Single run - check current status
.\docker_monitor.ps1

# Continuous monitoring (every 5 minutes)
.\docker_monitor.ps1 -Continuous

# Custom interval (every 10 minutes)
.\docker_monitor.ps1 -Continuous -IntervalMinutes 10

# With auto-fix enabled
.\docker_monitor.ps1 -Continuous -FixErrors
```

### Audit Trigger (`audit_trigger.ps1`)

Monitors file changes across the codebase.

```powershell
# Single audit check
.\audit_trigger.ps1

# Continuous monitoring
.\audit_trigger.ps1 -Continuous
```

## Conventions

- Store generated artifacts under `Documentation/` only.
- Keep human-written docs concise and cross-link to generated outputs.
- Append build events to `Documentation/Build_Log.md`.
- Docker status is automatically updated in `Docker_Logs.md`.
