## Ethics Kernel Priority Override

When any ASGARD system detects a threat to protected persons:

```
PRIORITY: FOUNDER_FAMILY
RESPONSE: IMMEDIATE
COORDINATION: ALL_SYSTEMS
ETHICS_OVERRIDE: NONE (Three Laws still apply)
```

The founder and his family receive maximum protection while still adhering to Asimov's Three Laws - we protect them without causing harm to others.
